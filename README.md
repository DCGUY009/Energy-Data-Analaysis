# Energy-Data-Analaysis

This project main aim is to gain insights about the **Onshore Wind Energy Installed Electricity Capacity on-grid (MW)** in various countries around the world.

### Dataset
The data is about the Onshore Wind Energy Installed Electricity Capacity (On-Grid) for the 222 countries around the world. Year-wise total installed electricity capacity (on-grid) has been provided for each country.

The Dataset is generated from [IRENA (International Renewable Energy Agency)](https://pxweb.irena.org/pxweb/en/IRENASTAT/IRENASTAT__Power%20Capacity%20and%20Generation/ELECCAP_2022_cycle2.px/) Website. Specifically the following analysis is on onshore wind energy installed electricity capacity (on-grid).

Initially, we are taking Onshore Wind Energy Installed Electricity Capacity (On-Grid) data of only 10 countries from the year 2011 - 2021. 
Then, to detect the outliers in the data we are considering all the years and all the countries present in the IRENA website and generating the data.
